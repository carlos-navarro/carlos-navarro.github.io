# Experience

## AXA Group Operations
<sub>Design Authority and Mobile Team Lead | July 2019 – XX 2020</sub>

On July 2019 I managed both the Design Aithority and the Mobile teams, completing a team of 10 people.

My role as OpenPaaS GPO was also extended adding the new AWS GPO role (that was temporary only until June 2020) and I began to collaborate with the recently created Engineering Excellence Office and joined the Group Operations Applications Architecture team as an external collaborator.
 
Exceptionally, for different reasons that can only be explained by the 2020-effect, I was also wearing the Interim Security Officer hat.

## AXA Group Operations
<sub>Design Authority Team Lead | July 2018 – August 2019</sub>

In mid 2018 I joined Group Operations Digital Products as the lead Solutions Architect and started managing a diverse team of 6 people (including Architects, DevOps engineers and Data engineers).
During this stage we migrated to OpenPaaS and decommissioned the OpenCAM platform and achieved the ISO 27001 certification for Digital.
My only additional hat in those days was the OpenPaaS GPO one.

## AXA Seguros
<sub>Java Solutions Architect | July 2015 – July 2018</sub>

On July 2015 I joined the Architecture department focusing obviously in Java solutions.

I led different streams:
- Simplification and migration of the portfolio of Java servers to JBoss 5 and 6 Migration from local IAM to the Regional one.
- Adoption of Microsoft TFS and the subsequent migration to the Regional counterpart and then to GitHub Enterprise
- Migration to the pIaaS on the scope of BB3B. 

And wore a few additional hats:
- AXA Seguros PO for OpenPaaS
- Red Hat SPOC

## AXA Seguros
<sub>Java Tech Lead | December 2006 – July 2015</sub>

When AXA completed the acquisition of Winterthur, I returned to my Java Tech Lead role. In those days I led some streams:
- Migration of the Java Enterprise servers from IONA Orbix Enterprise Server to Red Hat’s JBoss Enterprise Server
- Move from Winterthur’s BCN data center to SEDC
- Evolution of the underwriting platform to add the Health portfolio of products and the Pension ones. The new Java based underwriting platform covered in his final stage all underwriting products but Life and Investments (except Pensions).

And wore an additional hat, the Red Hat SPOC one.

## Winterthur Seguros
<sub>P&C Team Lead | August 2003 – December 2006</sub>

I started my journey in Winterthur around 2001 as one of the external Tech Leads involved in the migration of the P&C and H&A underwriting platforms from Host to Java.
 
In 2003 I joined Winterthur as the owner of the new Java platform and leading the IT P&C Team, a total of 5 people.

 

# Skills Summary
- I have very good resilience and adaptation abilities and an enormous appetite for learning.
- I tend to be more creative than efficient. But this could be the consequence of the adaptation to the continuous context-switching I’m facing in my everyday work.
- I would say that I’m a ‘not-so-bad’ architect, engineer, tech lead and manager. Which means that maybe I’m doing too many things or maybe I cannot be any better.
- I really like thinking outside the box and I’m an advocate of the lifelong learning.
- I enjoy managing people, but I even enjoy more managing culture. I’m very interested in diversity, inclusion and equity and sustainability topics.
- And I forgot to mention that I love good humor.

# Education
- Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (Ingeniero Técnico Superior de Telecomunicaciones por la Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña).
